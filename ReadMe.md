# Latent Interpolation on MNIST
I found doing linear interpolation in the latent space quite gratifying to watch. So I have created this respository which allows you to create a countdown or countup GIF with MNIST images using smooth transitions that comes from the latent space. 

## Sample Output
You can choose any range of numbers from 0-9 to create the GIF.
<table style="width:100%; border:0;">
  <thead><tr><th>Count Down</th><th>Count Up</th></tr></thead>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><img src="./output/countdown.gif"></td>
    <td align="center"><img src="./output/countup.gif"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Model
You can use this pre-trained model to generate your own GIF.
